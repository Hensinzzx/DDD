Hi Richard,
	I reviewed the book "Analysis and Design of Analog integrated
Circuits" by Paul R. Gray and Robert G. Mayer. Following is
some typical performance charateristics:

	*GBW ,
	*input and transfer impedence,
	power
	*gain
	*phase margin
	slew rate
	*noise
	output range
	input range
	input offset voltage and current (for opamp)
	*CMRR: comon mode rejection rate (for coamp)
	PSRR: ?

I think the items begining with * are related to 
the calculation of determinant. As to noise
part, different devices may have different noise 
types( Thermal, Flicker, Burst noise etc). The noise
is treated as independent noise generator 
for some devices. So after we know the gain
and input impedence, output noise can be calculated easily.
As to other charateristics, I think the exact
expressions are not very lengthy. So they do not
need DDD to repsensent them. For instance, offset
usualy is related to the input stage of opamp. 
As to the power and slew rate, I don't have
clear idea of how they can calculated. I need
to look the book further.

	The new data for the first two examples of optimization
paper will be ready soon. Where is the newest version of
the paper? I tried the single circuit yesterday and the 
result is very promising. The steep_ga usually take 4-5
generation to reach the optimal sulation(<2%), while
the pure GA still need a lot of time to do it. I will
try the miller circuit tonight.
