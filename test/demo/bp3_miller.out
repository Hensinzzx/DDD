: ! 'run' is to perform the symbolic and numerical analysis.
: ! It first builds the MNA matrix and then derives the symbolic
: ! expressions required in terms of DDDs. Finally, it perferm
: ! the numerical evluation on the resulting symbolic expressions.
: ! The times used for DDD construation and numerical evluation
: ! are also printed out.
: ! We do twice as we have some problems with the first run.
