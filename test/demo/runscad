! 'run' is to perform the symbolic and numerical analysis.
! It first builds the MNA matrix and then derives the symbolic
! expressions required in terms of DDDs. Finally, it perferm
! the numerical evluation on the resulting symbolic expressions.
! The times used for DDD construation and numerical evluation
! are also printed out.
! We do twice as we have some problems with the first run.

! 'plot' uses xgraph to display the numerical evluation results.
