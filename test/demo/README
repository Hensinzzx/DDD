bp2_miller.** --- band-pass filter without partitoning and using miller Opamp
                  as the implementation of the Opamps used (2 level).
bp3_miller.** --- Manually partitioned band-pass filter using miller Opamp
		  as the implementation of the Opamp used (3 level).
lp_linear.**  --- low-pass filter (used as the illustrative exmaple) using
                  u741 linear Opamp model as the implementation of the
		  Opamp used.
lp_miller.**  --- low-pass filter (used as the illustrative exmaple) using
                  miller Opamp model as the implementation of the Opamp used.
		  
ua741h.**     --- 3-level partitioned u741 Opamp circuit (last example of 
		  the submited jounal paper)
utility program:

calterm       --- help count the #terms from the log files of scad3
	          Usage: calterm log.file
		  It uses another program bb as subroutine.
		  The number obtained should be substract the #terms 
		  in the last circuit matrix in the log file to obtain
		  the correct the #term used for whole circuit.
runscad      ---- run scad3 in batch mode and generate *.out file for
 		  detailed analysis.
		  Usage: runscad file_name (without .sp suffix)
